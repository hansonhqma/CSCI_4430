## Programming language spectrum

### Imperative languages

- Evolved from Von Neumann computer architecture (memory stores instructions/data, communicates with ALU and control unit)
- Most popular programming paradigm
- Based around variables and assignment statement
- Programs are sequences of imperative statements
- Program execution is a sequence of transisions on memory state

Problems with imperative languages are difficulties with:
- Understanding programs
- Reasoning about correctness of programs

### Functional languages

Motivation for functional languages is if programming can be liberated from the Von Neumann architecture
