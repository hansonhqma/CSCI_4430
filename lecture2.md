## Syntax vs Semantics

**Syntax**: form, or structure of expressions, statments, and program units of a language

`while(expr){statement;}`

Is the syntax of a while loop in C-family languages

**Semantics**: meaning of expressions, statements, and program units of a languages: the semantics of 

`while(expr){statement;}`

Is "execute `statement` repeatedly whilest `expr` remains `True`"

## Some automata theory

- A *language* is a set of strings (called sentences) generated from a finite alphabet (finite set of characters)
- A *generator* is the set of rules that generate the strings in the language
- A *recognizer* reads strings as input and determines whether or not they could have been generated by the language

## Classes of formal languages

**Languages are characterized by the complexity of generation/recognition rules**.

The Chomsky hierarchy, in order of complexity:

1. Regular languages
   - Describe tokens in programming languages (keywords, identifiers, literals)
   - Regex's generate regular languages
   - Can be recognized with a finite automata (scanner in compilers)
2. Context-free languages
   - Describe more complex programming language schemes (expressions, statements)
   - Generated by context-free grammar
   - Recognized by push-down automaton (parser in compilers)
3. Context-sensitive languages
4. Recursively enumerable languages

Past context-free languages, generators and recognizers become very complex

### Motivation for formal languages

Can enable the classification, or proof of difficulty among computational problems

Basically, **formal languages are the contructs that describe programming languages**
- Using fl's, we can build scanners, parsers, and compilers as a whole
- Central problem is building efficient ones

## Regular expressions

Simplest structure, describes regular languages, identifies tokens in programming languages

- Symbols, `+`, `-`, etc.
- Identifers `foo`, `bar`, etc.
- Literals `20`, `False`, etc.

Are all tokens

As stated above, tokens in a programming language form a regular language, generated by regular expressions, recognized by finite automata

**A regular expression is one of the following:**

- Singular character
- Empty string $\epsilon$
- Multiple regular expressions concatenated with each other
- The union of regular expressions
- Kleene star

Suppose we have the regex `a|b`, which represents the string set `{a,b}`, and the regex `aa|bb` which represents the string set `{aa, bb}`.

If we define the regex `(a|b) (aa|bb)`, this is the set of all strings `a` or `b` followed by the strings `aa` or `bb`:

`(a|b) (aa|bb) = {aaa, abb, baa, bbb}`

The operator `*` is a multiple concatenation operator:

For some regex `L`, the regex `L*` is the concatenation of 0 to infinite strings generated by `L`.

For example, `a*` generates the set of strings `{a, aa, aaa, ...}`
